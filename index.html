    <h1>Eulogy</h1>
    <h2>by Tool</h2>
    <p>He had a lot to say
        He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
        We'll miss him
        He had a lot to say
        He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
        We'll miss him
        We're gonna miss him
        We're gonna miss him</p>
        
    <p>So long
        We wish you well
        You told us how you weren't afraid to die
        Well, so long
        Don't cry
        Or feel too down
        Not all martyrs see divinity
        But at least you tried</p>
        
    <p>Standing above the crowd
        He had a voice that was strong and loud, we'll miss him
        We'll miss him
        Ranting and pointing his finger
        At everything but his heart, we'll miss him
        We'll miss him
        We're gonna miss him
        We're gonna miss him
        Yeah, no way, yeah
        To recall
        What it was that you had said to me
        Like I care at all
        But it was so loud
        And you sure could yell
        You took a stand on every little thing
        And it was so loud</p>
        
    <p>You could be the one who saves me from my own existence</p>
        
    <p>Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two</p>
        
    <p>I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you
        So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea
        Like torment of my ego
        And we're amused by this</p>
        
    <p>Yeah, standing above the crowd
        He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
        Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so
        Eager to identify with
        Someone above the ground
        Someone who seemed to feel the same
        Someone prepared to lead the way, and
        Someone who would die for me
        Will you?
        Will you now?
        Would you die for me?
        Don't you fuckin' lie
        Don't you step out of line
        Don't you step out of line
        Don't you step out of line
        Don't you fuckin' lie</p>
        
    <p>You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
        Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?</p>
        
    <p>He had a lot to say
        He had a lot of nothing to say
        He had a lot to say
        He had a lot of nothing to say</p>
        
    <p>Come down
        Get off your fuckin' cross
        We need the fuckin' space
        To nail the next fool martyr</p>
        
    <p>To ascend you must die
        You must be crucified
        For our sins and our lies
        Goodbye</p>
