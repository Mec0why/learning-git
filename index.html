            <p>He had a lot to say<br>
                He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him<br>
                We'll miss him<br>
                He had a lot to say<br>
                He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him<br>
                We'll miss him<br>
                We're gonna miss him<br>
                We're gonna miss him</p>

            <p>So long<br>
                We wish you well<br>
                You told us how you weren't afraid to die<br>
                Well, so long<br>
                Don't cry<br>
                Or feel too down<br>
                Not all martyrs see divinity<br>
                But at least you tried</p>

            <p>Standing above the crowd<br>
                He had a voice that was strong and loud, we'll miss him<br>
                We'll miss him<br>
                Ranting and pointing his finger<br>
                At everything but his heart, we'll miss him<br>
                We'll miss him<br>
                We're gonna miss him<br>
                We're gonna miss him<br>
                Yeah, no way, yeah<br>
                To recall<br>
                What it was that you had said to me<br>
                Like I care at all<br>
                But it was so loud<br>
                And you sure could yell<br>
                You took a stand on every little thing<br>
                And it was so loud</p>

            <p>You could be the one who saves me from my own existence</p>

            <p>Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two</p>

            <p>I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you<br>
                So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea<br>
                Like torment of my ego<br>
                And we're amused by this</p>

            <p>Yeah, standing above the crowd<br>
                He had a voice that was strong and loud and I<br>
                Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so<br>
                Eager to identify with<br>
                Someone above the ground<br>
                Someone who seemed to feel the same<br>
                Someone prepared to lead the way, and<br>
                Someone who would die for me<br>
                Will you?<br>
                Will you now?<br>
                Would you die for me?<br>
                Don't you fuckin' lie<br>
                Don't you step out of line<br>
                Don't you step out of line<br>
                Don't you step out of line<br>
                Don't you fuckin' lie</p>

            <p>You've claimed all this time that you would die for me<br>
                Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?</p>

            <p>He had a lot to say<br>
                He had a lot of nothing to say<br>
                He had a lot to say<br>
                He had a lot of nothing to say</p>

            <p>Come down<br>
                Get off your fuckin' cross<br>
                We need the fuckin' space<br>
                To nail the next fool martyr</p>

            <p>To ascend you must die<br>
                You must be crucified<br>
                For our sins and our lies<br>
                Goodbye</p>
